1) make both beacon_client and server into daemons.  Create proper init.d 
   scripts.    DONE
2) make server.py use twisted (possibly).
3) change home directory for beacon_client to somewhere other than /tmp
		DONE (variablized)

4) Do config file via ConfigParser
5) Figure out why beaconclient crashes
